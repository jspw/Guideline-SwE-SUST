> Software Engineering Guideline,  Instpired by [web-developer-roadmap.](https://github.com/kamranahmedse/developer-roadmap)

We are studying Software Engineering or Related subjects but some of us don't know what we are studying or don't have a guideline or don't know how vast the Software Engineering or IT sector is or We just don't know which path we should choose. **Forget choosing path , even we don't know what are the options!**
So I have tried to give some informations and introduce with terminologies which are related to Software Engineering and IT and can help to know our options and choose them properly!

It's not a roadmap which you should follow and will make you GOD in IT sector. It will just show you some stuffs that can help you to choose your path! I have just use the terms and basic stuffs so that you can google them :p

**These `X year Y semester` are just for remembering that you can give `Z` months to know these things well though it can vary from person to person and I have just tried to relate these things and time with our Varsity Syllabus and curriculum !**

## First Year First Semester

First of all you have to learn about Computer,its pros and cons and basic things.

**(If you know a language well then shifting or learning new languages will be very easy)**

**After that you can make some fun projects like game or application using that language**
